# AI-Powered-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-ASD-Diagnostic-System

 Detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a com
plex process due to the lack of definitive medical tests and
 the reliance on subjective behavioral assessments. ASD is
 characterized by persistent difficulties in social communi
cation and repetitive or restricted behaviors. Among key
 diagnostic markers, atypical eye movement patterns have
 been identified as a distinguishing characteristic of people
 with ASD. In this work, we utilize the eye tracking data,
 collected from children, for ASD detection. Eye movement
 data, collected over time, were compressed into RGBA im
ages, creating a dataset that encapsulates both spatial and
 temporal gaze dynamics [1]. Using this dataset, we em
ploy Deep Learning techniques to classify the images and
 diagnose ASD. This approach offers a diagnostic tool that
 minimizes the need for extensive behavioral observation in
 clinical environments. Furthermore, our method can serve
 as an early screening mechanism, paving the way for more
 comprehensive and targeted evaluation of suspected indi
viduals, thus improving early detection and timely interven
tion for ASD. In this work, we introduce a novel individual
level diagnostic approach by aggregating predictions from
 multiple eye-tracking images of the same participant using
 sequence modeling techniques such as LSTM with attention
 and Transformers.
